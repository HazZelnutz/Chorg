# Chorg - The Open Source Chart Organizer

With Chorg you can organize all your aviation charts for flight simulation.

Chorg takes a PDF of your airport and stores it in its database.
From there on you can set information for every page / chart like:

- Content: General, SID, STAR, ...
- Name: ILS LOC Rwy 32R
- Identifer: 10-02A
- Keywords: *STAR 1*, *STAR 2*, ...

> Chorg works best with a single PDF with one chart per page!

## Building
To build edit `make.bat` and change the path to your msbuild.exe.
Then just start the batch file.
A folder with the built .exe should pop open.
